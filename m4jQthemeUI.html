    <h3>The Road to Hana</h3>
    
    <p>Along Maui's rugged eastern coastline is the peaceful town of Hāna, considered one of the last unspoiled Hawaiian frontiers. The legendary road to Hāna is only 52 miles from the airport in Kahului; however, the drive can take anywhere from two to four hours to complete since it's fraught with narrow one-lane bridges, hairpin turns and incredible island views. Take a look at the widgets below to learn more about the incredible drive.</p>
    
    <div id="accordion">
        <h3 title="Click each header to expand.">Crazy Curves</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                The Hāna Highway (HI-360) has 620 curves and 59 bridges. The road leads you through flourishing rainforests, flowing waterfalls, plunging pools and dramatic seascapes.  Please keep in mind that you’ll encounter challenging turns and narrow bridges along the way, so it’s important to exercise caution and take your time. Joining a tour will eliminate stress for the driver and passengers, allowing for a more enjoyable experience and guides provide valuable insights about the surrounding area and its cultural history. There  are plenty of opportunities to stop and enjoy the lovely views. While it’s all about the journey, once you reach the beautiful and quiet town of Hāna, you’ll see why it’s worth the trip.

            <div>
                <p>
                At first, the road is a wide, paved, two lane road. However, many sections are narrower and less maintained. The stretch of road between the Nu’u Refuge and Kaupo Town is the roughest. For about 8 miles, the road alternates between a very rough, paved road and a short stretch of smoother, gravel road. Yes, the gravel road was smoother than some of the paved roads on this section of the drive. It’s almost like someone threw globs of asphalt onto the road, making it very lumpy and rough to drive.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h3 title="Click each header to expand.">Drive Considerately</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                The Road to Hana is one of the most popular things to do in Maui. And because of this, the increased congestion on the roads, combined with visitors disobeying posted no parking signs, creates traffic jams and slow moving traffic. The locals who live along the road are rightfully frustrated. So, if you are not even sure if you want to drive the Road to Hana, skip the experience. There are many other things to do in Maui that are better (in my opinion) than driving the Road to Hana. In other words, drive safely and considerately.

    <p>While the drive is an... experience in itself, the town of Hana and the many stops along the way are absolutely worth it. Take a look below to learn more.</p>

            <p>Historic St. Sophia’s Church marks your arrival into Hāna, where the pastures roll right up to the main street. The historic Hana-Maui Resort is a luxurious retreat in this village rooted in Hawaiian tradition. Browse the Hasegawa General Store and Hāna Ranch Store for unique souvenirs. Swim and sunbathe at Hāna Beach Park or Hāmoa Beach, cited by author James Michener as the most beautiful beach in the Pacific. Sunbathe at Waiʻānapanapa State Park (advanced reservations required), a beautiful black sand beach. Or visit Hale Piʻilani, the state’s largest heiau (Hawaiian temple), in Kahanu Garden, one of five National Tropical Botanical Gardens in Hawaiʻi.</p>

        <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>As you head north on Hana Highway, you can turn right on Haneoo Road to see two beaches: Hamoa Beach and Koki Beach Park. Hamoa Beach is a popular spot for surfing and boogie boarding. ust up the road from Hamoa Beach, Koki Beach looks dramatically different… a reddish sand beach littered with cinders and lava rock. Two miles (about a 5 minute drive) north of Koki Beach Park you reach Hana Town. This very small town is a good spot to grab a bite to eat and refuel your car with gas (the Texaco on the south side of town is the only gas station that I know of on the Road to Hana). Thai food by Pranee and Ae’s Thai Kitchen food truck both get great reviews. If you want something sweet, try the coconut ice cream at Coconut Glen’s.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>Wai’napanapa State Park is one of the best things to do along the Road to Hana. Most people come here to see the black sand beach, but you can also crawl into a sea cave, hike along the dramatic coastline, and see if you can spot the sea arch. The jet black sand beach is the highlight of a visit here. The sea cave is located on the right side of the beach. Look for a small opening in the rock wall at ground level. You will have to crouch quite low to get into the cave, but once inside, there is plenty of room to stand up and enjoy the view.</p>
